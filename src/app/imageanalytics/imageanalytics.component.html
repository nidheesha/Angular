            <h3>Image Analytics</h3>
            <p>The data from the thermal and visual images were used and analysed through Detectâ€™s
			proprietary algorithms to generate the structural health map of the flare stack to help as
			decision making tools for maintenance activities.
			The 2D format of the health map of the chimney is shown below. The 3D form is
			available separately in the attached pen drive. Inspection and maintenance engineers are
			advised to read the appendix to know the file paths to the same.</p>
